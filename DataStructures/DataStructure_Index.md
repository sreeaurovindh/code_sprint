https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb3g_Z8nEv1h1w6MI8vNMuL_wrI0FtqE7

This series starts off with explaining some super important concepts like divide and conquer, dp, dp state, DAG representation of a DP solution.

To build upon these concepts and provide a strong foundation I follow with numerous illustrations with both intuition and implementation for each problem.
